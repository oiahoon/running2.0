## General Questions

### What is Running Page 2.0?

Running Page 2.0 is a modern, self-hosted web application that creates a beautiful personal dashboard for your running activities. It automatically syncs with Strava, displays interactive maps, provides detailed statistics, and includes cost-effective static map caching.

### How is this different from the original running_page?

Running Page 2.0 offers several improvements:
- ‚úÖ **Modern tech stack** (Next.js 14, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS)
- ‚úÖ **Static map caching** for 99% cost reduction
- ‚úÖ **Better mobile experience** with responsive design
- ‚úÖ **Enhanced visualizations** with interactive charts
- ‚úÖ **Improved performance** and reliability
- ‚úÖ **Easier deployment** with one-click setup

### Do I need coding experience?

No! The setup process is designed for non-developers:
- **Fork** the repository (1 click)
- **Deploy** to Vercel (1 click)
- **Configure** through web interfaces
- **Customize** through environment variables

### Is it free to use?

Yes! The core application is completely free:
- ‚úÖ **GitHub** - Free for public repositories
- ‚úÖ **Vercel** - Free tier includes hosting
- ‚úÖ **Strava API** - Free for personal use
- ‚úÖ **Mapbox** - Free tier (50k requests/month)

With static map caching, ongoing costs are virtually zero.

## Setup and Configuration

### How long does setup take?

- **Quick setup**: 15 minutes (basic functionality)
- **Full setup**: 30-45 minutes (including maps and customization)
- **First data sync**: 5-15 minutes (depending on activity count)

### What accounts do I need?

**Required**:
- GitHub account (free)
- Vercel account (free)
- Strava account with activities

**Optional**:
- Mapbox account (for maps, free tier available)

### Can I use other fitness platforms besides Strava?

Currently, only Strava is supported. However, the architecture allows for future integrations with:
- Garmin Connect
- Polar Flow
- Nike Run Club
- GPX file imports

### What if I don't have many activities?

The page works with any number of activities:
- **Few activities**: Still provides nice visualization and tracking
- **Many activities**: Showcases your running journey beautifully
- **No activities yet**: Perfect motivation to start running!

## Strava Integration

### Why do I need to create a Strava app?

Strava requires API applications for data access. Creating your own app ensures:
- ‚úÖ **Your data stays private** (only you have access)
- ‚úÖ **No rate limit sharing** with other users
- ‚úÖ **Full control** over permissions and data
- ‚úÖ **Compliance** with Strava's terms of service

### What Strava data is accessed?

The application accesses:
- ‚úÖ **Public profile information** (name, photo)
- ‚úÖ **Activity data** (distance, time, pace, elevation)
- ‚úÖ **GPS routes** (for map visualization)
- ‚úÖ **Activity metadata** (type, date, location)

**Not accessed**:
- ‚ùå Private messages or social interactions
- ‚ùå Other athletes' private data
- ‚ùå Payment or subscription information

### How often does data sync?

- **Automatic sync**: Every 6 hours by default
- **Manual sync**: Anytime through GitHub Actions
- **Customizable**: Change frequency in workflow configuration
- **Incremental**: Only new/changed activities are processed

### What if I make my Strava activities private?

- **Public activities**: Always accessible
- **Private activities**: Require `activity:read_all` scope
- **Followers-only**: Treated as private activities
- **Privacy zones**: Respected and not displayed

## Maps and Visualization

### Do I need Mapbox for maps?

Maps are optional but highly recommended:
- **Without Mapbox**: Activity list with basic location info
- **With Mapbox**: Interactive route maps and visualizations
- **Free tier**: 50,000 map loads per month
- **Static caching**: Reduces usage by 99%+

### How does static map caching work?

Static map caching pre-generates map images:
1. **First time**: Generate PNG image via Mapbox API
2. **Storage**: Save image in your repository
3. **Future loads**: Serve cached image directly
4. **Result**: 99% reduction in API calls and costs

### Can I customize map styles?

Yes! You can customize:
- **Map style**: Streets, satellite, outdoors, dark, light
- **Colors**: Route colors, markers, overlays
- **Size**: Image dimensions and quality
- **Elements**: Start/end markers, route highlighting

### What if GPS data is inaccurate?

The system displays data as provided by Strava:
- **Strava processing**: Routes are processed by Strava first
- **Privacy zones**: Automatically handled
- **Data quality**: Depends on your GPS device/phone
- **Manual correction**: Edit activities in Strava, then re-sync

## Data and Privacy

### Where is my data stored?

Your data is stored in multiple places:
- **GitHub repository**: SQLite database and cached maps
- **Vercel**: Deployed application and database
- **Your browser**: Temporary caching only

**Important**: All storage is under your control.

### Is my data secure?

Yes, security is built-in:
- ‚úÖ **Private repository**: Your fork can be private
- ‚úÖ **Encrypted secrets**: GitHub Secrets are encrypted
- ‚úÖ **HTTPS**: All connections are encrypted
- ‚úÖ **No third-party tracking**: No analytics or tracking
- ‚úÖ **Your control**: You own all data and infrastructure

### Can I delete my data?

Absolutely:
- **Delete repository**: Removes all code and data
- **Delete Vercel project**: Removes deployed application
- **Revoke Strava access**: Removes API permissions
- **Local backups**: Download data before deletion

### Who can see my running page?

By default, your running page is public on the internet. You can:
- **Keep public**: Share with friends and family
- **Make private**: Configure authentication (advanced)
- **Custom domain**: Use your own domain name
- **Password protect**: Add authentication layer

## Costs and Pricing
